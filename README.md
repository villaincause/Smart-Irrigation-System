## Introduction

The "Smart Irrigation System" is a project developed by the VOVO Circuit team, code devloped by Abubakar Siddiq Sazzad (aka Kaito) and Prince Islam. This project aims to create an efficient and automated irrigation system using Arduino and the ESP8266 NOD MCU board. The system is designed to intelligently monitor and control the watering of plants based on various environmental factors, helping to conserve water and ensure optimal plant growth.

## Features

- Automated watering based on soil moisture levels.
- Remote monitoring and control via the internet.
- Real-time data visualization of soil moisture and system status.
- Customizable watering schedules and thresholds.
- Low water level alerts and notifications.

## Components

The Smart Irrigation System project requires the following components:

- ESP8266 NOD MCU board
- Soil moisture sensor
- Water pump
- Relay module
- Power supply (DC)
- Water reservoir
- Peristaltic pump (optional, for precise water flow)
- 16x2 LCD display (optional, for local data display)
- Enclosure (optional, for protection against environmental elements)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the Arduino code (smart_irrigation_system.ino) to your ESP8266 NOD MCU board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the required components according to the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
4. Install any necessary libraries used in the project.
5. Power up the system and connect it to the internet if you wish to enable remote monitoring and control.

## Usage
1. Once the system is set up and powered on, it will start monitoring the soil moisture levels.
2. The system will automatically water the plants when the soil moisture falls below a certain threshold.
3. You can access the web interface or mobile application to remotely monitor the system and change settings.
4. The LCD display (if used) will show real-time data such as soil moisture, pump status, and Wi-Fi connectivity.
5. Customize the watering schedules and thresholds according to your specific plant requirements.
